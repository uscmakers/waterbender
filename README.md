# Waterbender

Waterbender is an art installation that is meant to be interacted with by anyone walking by. Using a built in webapp, user can create their own custom 2D designs, which are then displayed by dynamic streams of water.

## Overview

Waterbender creates 2D designs with vertical streams of water. Each stream of water is controlled by an electric valve that is hooked up to our microcontroller. Our project is a fully independent, integrated system that automatically displays user inputted images, and regulates its own water levels using top and bottom water reservoirs, pumps, and water level sensors.

## Timeline
### Fall Semester
As is typically done in industry, we started off our design with a proof of concept, that had the core features we needed to make a minimum viable product:

This design only used 10 smaller valves, had simpler code, and was dwarved by our spring semester iteration:
